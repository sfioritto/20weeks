# Week 1 of 20

You used your rest day on Monday, so you'll need to get either a run or lift each day to avoid doubling up. Current status: 1 run done on Tuesday, 0 lifts. Your calories are at 1900 and steps at 5112 for Monday - both on target. Keep hitting those daily minimums while getting one workout per day. I notice you logged your sleep for Monday night - good. Focus on getting a lift done today and keeping the momentum going.
