# Week 2 of 20

Week 1 complete. You hit all required goals: 3 runs, 3 lifts, calories averaged 1920 (within acceptable range), steps averaged 5741. Strong finish with Sunday's high-volume lift session. Sleep was disrupted a few nights with Ada's wake-ups, but you powered through. This week, spread your workouts more evenly instead of cramming them Thursday-Sunday. You've got your rest day available again.
