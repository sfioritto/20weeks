# Week 1 of 20

You've hit all 3 runs and now have 2 lifts done - just need 1 more by Sunday. Calories are averaging 1921 (within range), steps averaging 5648 (solid). Friday's 2033 calories pushed the average up a bit, but you're still within the acceptable range. If you're tired from Ada's sleep disruptions, remember that even one set of each exercise counts as a lift session.
