# Week 3 of 20

You used your rest day on Monday, so you'll need to get either a run or lift each of the remaining 3 days to avoid doubling up. Current status: 1 run done, 0 lifts done. Your calories are averaging 2004 - that's 104 over target, need to keep it under 1746 calories per day for the remaining 3 days to hit 1950 average. Steps are averaging 6882 - you're on track there. You mentioned you're not pushing for all workouts this week - but you still need 2 more runs and at least 2 lifts to pass the week. Thursday was particularly low on fiber at 18g.

## This Week's Focus

You need to double up workouts at least once - you said you're aiming for just 2 lifts but 3 are required to pass. Keep calories under 1746 for remaining days to fix the average.

## Next Lift Day (Deadlifts)

**Main Lift**
- Deadlift: 3 sets × 8-10 reps (Last session: 3 x 8, 135lbs)

**Accessory Work**
- Walking Lunges (dumbbells): 3 sets × 12 reps per leg (Last session: 1 x 12, 30lbs)
- Bent-Over Barbell Row: 3 sets × 12 reps (Last session: 2 x 12, 45lbs)
- Dumbbell Row (both arms): 3 sets × 12 reps (Last session: 3 x 12, 30lbs)
- Dumbbell Shoulder Press: 3 sets × 15 reps (Last session: 3 x 15, 30lbs)

Progression suggestions for +2% volume:
- Deadlift: Aim for 3 x 9 or add 5-10lbs
- Complete all 3 sets for lunges and rows
- Consider adding 5lbs to shoulder press or adding a 4th set

Remember: Even completing one set of each exercise counts as a lifting session if you're exhausted.
