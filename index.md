# Week 1 of 20

You've got 1 run and 1 lift done. Calories averaging 1905 (5 over but acceptable), steps averaging 5446 (solid). Used your rest day Monday, so you'll need a workout each day to avoid doubling up. Sleep's been disrupted by Ada a couple nights, but you're still getting the workouts done. Need 2 more runs and 2 more lifts by Sunday. Nice job on protein and fiber yesterday.
