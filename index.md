# Week 2 of 20

Four days into Week 2 and you're tracking well. Monday was your rest day (no workout logged), which means you need to hit a workout each remaining day to avoid doubling up. Current status: 2 runs done, 1 lift done. Calories averaging 1915 (good), steps at 5919 (solid). You've already knocked out today's run, so you need 1 more run and 2 more lifts by Sunday. Keep this steady pace going.
