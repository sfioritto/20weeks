# Week 1 of 20

You've got 1 run and 1 lift done. Calories averaging 1891 (good), but steps averaging 4871 - need 5129 steps per day for the remaining 5 days to hit the 5000 average. Used your rest day Monday, so you'll need a workout each day to avoid doubling up. Sleep's been disrupted both nights by Ada, but you can still train - even one set counts, naps are allowed. Need to log today's calories and steps still.
