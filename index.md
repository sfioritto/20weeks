# Week 1 of 20

You've used your rest day on Wednesday, so you need to get either a run or lift in each remaining day to avoid doubling up. Current status: 1 run done, 2 lifts done. Calories are averaging 2138 (238 over target) - need to average 1612 calories for the remaining 3 days to get back to 1900. Steps averaging 6790 (good). Just need 2 more runs by Sunday to complete the week. Today's lift is already done, so focus on getting those runs in.
