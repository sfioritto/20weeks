# Week 1 of 20

You've used your rest day on Wednesday, so you need to get either a run or lift in each remaining day to avoid doubling up. Current status: 2 runs done, 2 lifts done. Calories are averaging 2000 (100 over target) - need to average 1800 calories for the remaining 2 days to get back to 1900. Steps averaging 5964 (good). Just need 1 more run and 1 more lift by Sunday to complete the week. Friday's run is already done, so focus on getting that last lift in.
