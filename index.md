# Week 2 of 20

You're closing out Week 2 strong - all four required goals are green. Monday was your rest day (no workout logged), which means you've been hitting daily workouts since. Current status: 2 runs done, 2 lifts done, with one of each left for the weekend. Calories averaging 1891 (excellent), steps at 5791 (solid). Sleep's been rough most nights - remember even one set counts for lifting if you're exhausted. Just need 1 run and 1 lift over the next two days to complete the week.
