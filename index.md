# Week 3 of 20

You used your rest day on Monday, so you'll need to get either a run or lift each of the remaining 5 days to avoid doubling up. Current status: 0 runs done, 0 lifts done. Your calories are averaging 2092 - that's 192 over target, need to keep it under 1841 calories per day for the remaining 5 days to hit 1950 average. Steps are averaging 4195 - need 5402 steps per day for remaining 5 days to hit 5000 average. Tuesday was particularly low at 1600 steps. You've got work to do this week.

## This Week's Focus

Get a workout in every remaining day - you've already used your rest day. Focus on getting walks in to boost that step average back up, and keep calories under 1841 to fix the average.

## Next Lift Day (Deadlifts)

**Main Lift**
- Deadlift: 3 sets × 8-10 reps (Last session: 3 x 8, 135lbs)

**Accessory Work**
- Walking Lunges (dumbbells): 3 sets × 12 reps per leg (Last session: 1 x 12, 30lbs)
- Bent-Over Barbell Row: 3 sets × 12 reps (Last session: 2 x 12, 45lbs)
- Dumbbell Row (both arms): 3 sets × 12 reps (Last session: 3 x 12, 30lbs)
- Dumbbell Shoulder Press: 3 sets × 15 reps (Last session: 3 x 15, 30lbs)

Progression suggestions for +2% volume:
- Deadlift: Aim for 3 x 9 or add 5-10lbs
- Complete all 3 sets for lunges and rows
- Consider adding 5lbs to shoulder press or adding a 4th set

Remember: Even completing one set of each exercise counts as a lifting session if you're exhausted.
