# Week 2 of 20

You're three days into Week 2 with solid progress so far. You used your rest day on Monday, which means you'll need either a run or lift every day Thursday through Sunday to avoid doubling up. Current status: 1 run done Tuesday, 1 lift done today (Wednesday). Calories are averaging 1885 (good), steps at 5941 (good). Since you used Monday as your rest day, you need a workout each of the remaining 4 days. Also good job hitting bedtime Tuesday night - keep that consistency going.
