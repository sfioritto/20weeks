# Week 1 of 20

You've got 3 runs and 1 lift done - runs are complete. Calories averaging 1909 (9 over but acceptable), steps averaging 5708 (solid). You still need 2 more lifts by Sunday. Ada's sick sleep disruptions hit multiple nights but bedtime routine stayed consistent. If you're exhausted from the broken sleep, remember that even one set of each exercise counts as a lift session.
