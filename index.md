# Week 1 of 20

You've got 2 runs and 1 lift done - good momentum. Calories averaging 1894 (on target), steps averaging 5760 (solid). You still need 1 more run and 2 more lifts by Sunday. The consistent 10pm bedtime and 10:30pm lights out is working well despite Ada's disruptions. If you're feeling tired from the broken sleep, remember that even one set of each exercise counts as a lift session.
