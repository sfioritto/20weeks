# Week 2 of 20

You've completed all 3 runs for the week and got a big step day today (7680) which helped pull your average up. All four required goals are green now. Monday was your rest day (no workout logged), so you've been hitting consistent workouts since. Current status: 3 runs done, 2 lifts done. Calories averaging 1916 (good), steps at 5879 (solid). Need just 1 more lift by tomorrow to complete the week. Sleep's been rough most nights with Ada disrupting things, but you're getting through the workouts anyway.
