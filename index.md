# Week 2 of 20

You started Week 2 with Monday's numbers - 4374 steps (626 below target), 1865 calories (good), 174g protein. But no workouts logged. Today's Tuesday, so you need to get one workout done and spread your 3 runs and 3 lifts through the remaining days. Rest day is used up so you'll need to get a lift or run in each day if you don't want to be forced to double up.

## Today's Focus

Get a lift or run done today. Need extra steps daily to make up Monday's shortfall.

### Runs: 0/3

Week 2 target: 15.6 minutes per run.

### Lifts: 0/3

Need to start soon to avoid back-loading.

### Calories: avg 1865

Target: 1900 max (up to 1950 acceptable)

### Steps: avg 4374

626 below target. Need 5315 steps per day for remaining 6 days to hit 5000 average.

**Week status:** Behind on workouts - need to get started
