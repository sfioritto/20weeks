# Week 2 of 20

Week 2 complete. You hit all your required goals: 3 runs, 3 lifts, calories at 1934 average, steps at 6150 average. Monday was your rest day this week, so you did a good job spreading workouts across the remaining days. Got some bigger step days on the weekend that helped pull your average up nicely. Sleep's been rough with Ada waking you up multiple nights, but you powered through all the workouts anyway. Week 3 starts tomorrow - rest day is available again.

## Next Lift Day (Deadlifts)

**Main Lift**
- Deadlift: 3 sets × 8-10 reps (Last session: 3 x 8, 135lbs)

**Accessory Work**
- Walking Lunges (dumbbells): 3 sets × 12 reps per leg (Last session: 1 x 12, 30lbs)

Progression suggestions for +2% volume:
- Deadlift: Aim for 3 x 9 or add 5-10lbs
- Complete all 3 sets for lunges and rows
- Consider adding 5lbs to shoulder press or adding a 4th set

Remember: Even completing one set of each exercise counts as a lifting session if you're exhausted.
