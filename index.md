# Week 1 of 20

## Current Status

You're 6 days into Week 1. Here's where you stand:

### 🏃 Running: 2/3
You need **1 more run** by Sunday or you fail this week's running goal. It's only 15 minutes. No excuses - you can run when tired.

### 💪 Lifting: 3/3 ✅
Done. Good work. You've earned your rest day if you need it.

### 🍽️ Calories: Averaging 1869 ✅
You're **31 calories under** your 1900 target. Solid control. Keep it up.

### 🚶 Steps: Averaging 6356 ✅
You're **1356 steps above** your 5000 minimum. Good activity level.

### 🥩 Protein: 2/6 days hit ⚠️
Only hitting **33% of days** at 190g+. This needs work:
- Mon: ✅ 195g
- Tue: ❌ 165g (25g short)
- Wed: ❌ 165g (25g short)
- Thu: ✅ 190g
- Fri: ❌ 165g (25g short)
- Sat: ❌ 185g (5g short)

**Fix this:** You're leaving gains on the table. Add a protein shake or more chicken.

### 🌾 Fiber: 5/6 days hit ✅
Hitting **83% of days** at 30g+. Good except Wednesday (15g). Stay consistent.

### 😴 Sleep Schedule: Not tracked
Start tracking your 10pm bedtime and 6:30am wake time. Sleep is when you recover.

## Reality Check

**Bottom line:** You have 1 day left to get that final run in. If you don't run Sunday, you fail Week 1. 

It's only 20 weeks. Stay consistent and you earn rest days. Naps are allowed.

Remember: You committed to this. Don't negotiate with yourself.
