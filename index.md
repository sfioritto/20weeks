# Week 2 of 20

You're two days into Week 2 with mixed results. Monday you didn't work out (rest day used), Tuesday you got a run done. So you're at 1 run, 0 lifts with your rest day already spent - meaning you need a workout every remaining day to avoid doubling up. Steps are averaging 6162 (good), calories at 1867 (good). Since you used Monday as rest day, you'll need either a run or lift Wednesday through Sunday. Also, you've been hitting bedtime lately which is helping.
