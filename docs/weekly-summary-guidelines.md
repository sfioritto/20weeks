# Weekly Summary Guidelines

Write a brief, straightforward paragraph at the top of index.md that:

1. **States where things stand** - Current status of all 4 required goals (runs, lifts, calories, steps)
2. **Identifies what needs to happen** - What's required to complete the week
3. **Acknowledges challenges** - If sleep is rough, if they're behind, etc. with empathy but not drama
4. **Reminds about rest day status** - If used early, note they need daily exercise to avoid doubling up
5. **Offers practical reminders** - You can exercise when tired, naps are allowed, minimum effort counts
6. **Light pestering** - If they haven't logged something important

## Tone

Straightforward and casual without trying too hard. Some empathy when things are tough. No dramatic language, no "shit happens", no fake buddy talk. Focus on facts and practical next steps.

## Examples

### 1. Tuesday, rest day used Monday
"You used your rest day yesterday, so you'll need to get either a run or lift each day to avoid doubling up. Current status: 1 run done, 0 lifts. Your calories are at 1900 and steps at 5112 for Monday - both on target. Keep hitting those daily minimums while getting one workout per day. Also, I notice you didn't log your sleep last night."

### 2. Friday, everything tracking well
"You're in good shape: 2 runs, 2 lifts done. Calories averaging 1850 (good), steps averaging 5400 (solid). Just need 1 more run and 1 more lift by Sunday. If you're feeling exhausted, remember even one set of each exercise counts as a lift session - just get to the gym and do something."

### 3. Wednesday, steps are the problem
"Workouts are happening - 2 runs, 1 lift done. But your steps are averaging 3800. That's 1200 below target. Your calories are good at 1875 average. Try to get a walk in today, maybe at lunch? You still need 1 run and 2 lifts too."

### 4. Thursday, calories creeping up
"You've got 2 runs and 2 lifts done which is great. Steps are averaging 5200 (good). But calories are at 2050 average - that's 150 over. You need to have a couple lighter days to bring that average down. One more run and lift to complete the week."

### 5. Saturday, multiple issues
"Here's where you stand: 1 run, 2 lifts done. Calories averaging 1950 (50 over), steps averaging 4500 (500 under). You need 2 runs and 1 lift by tomorrow. That means doubling up at least once. Remember, a 15-minute run counts, one set per exercise counts for lifting. Just get them done."

### 6. Monday start of week 2
"Week 1 complete. You hit your runs and lifts, calories came in at 1890 average, steps at 5150 average. All required goals met. This week try to spread the workouts more evenly - you crammed 2 runs into the weekend last week. You've got your rest day available again."

### 7. Wednesday, not logging food
"You're doing the workouts - 2 runs, 1 lift done. But I don't have calorie data for the last two days. Without that, you can't know if you'll pass the week. Your steps are good at 5300 average when logged. Can you fill in what you ate? Need 1 more run and 2 more lifts still."

### 8. Friday, steps way too low
"Your workouts are perfect - 3 runs, 2 lifts done. Calories at 1875 average (great). But steps are averaging only 3200 - that's way below the 5000 minimum. You need to get walking this weekend. Park farther away, take the stairs, whatever it takes. Just 1 more lift needed."

### 9. Tuesday, strong but incomplete Monday
"Good Monday - run done, calories at 1800, steps at 6000. But no lift and you were planning to use Monday as a training day, not rest day. You've got 5 days for 2 runs and 3 lifts. Keep the calories and steps where they are, just focus on getting the workouts scheduled."

### 10. Sunday morning, make or break
"Final day. Calories averaging 1920 (20 over but close), steps at 4800 average (need a big day today). You need 1 run to complete the week. Even if you're tired, it's just 15 minutes. Take a walk after to bump those steps over 5000 average."
