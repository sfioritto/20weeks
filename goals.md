## Required per week:

- Average 1900 calories max per day (wiggle room up to 1950 is acceptable for the weekly average)
- Average 5000 steps per day (not including running) - This is a weekly average with reasonable wiggle room (4900-5100 all count as meeting the goal)
- Run 3 days per week
- Lift 3 days per week
- **Rest day:** 1 day per week with no run or lift required (6 workout days + 1 rest day = 7 days)

**Note on workouts:** The goal is to complete the assigned time/progression, but if you're exhausted, doing the minimum still counts. For lifts, even one set of each exercise counts as a session. For runs, completing the target time matters more than pace. The priority is building the habit and consistency.

## Bonus:

- Average 30g fiber per day
- 190g protein per day
- Bedtime: 6 out of 7 days per week
  - In bed by 10:00pm
  - Lights out by 10:30pm
  - Wake up at 6:30am (goal is consistency - both bedtime AND wake time)
  - If sleep is disrupted, may choose to sleep in, but waking after 6:30am means the goal wasn't fully met

## Progressive Training Goals:

### Running Progression (20 weeks)

- **Week 1:** 16:30 minutes
- **Week 20:** 25:00 minutes
- **Weekly increase:** ~2.21% compounded
- **Formula:** Week N = 16.5 × (1.0221)^(N-1) minutes

### Lifting Volume Progression

- **Weekly increase:** +2% total volume
- **Formula:** Week N = Baseline × (1.02)^(N-1)
- Track volume as: sets × reps × weight
- Apply multiplier to maintain progressive overload
