## Required per week:

- Average 1900 calories max per day
- Average 5000 steps per day (not including running)
- Run 3 days per week
- Lift 3 days per week

**Note on workouts:** The goal is to complete the assigned time/progression, but if you're exhausted, doing the minimum still counts. For lifts, even one set of each exercise counts as a session. For runs, completing the target time matters more than pace. The priority is building the habit and consistency.

## Bonus:

- Average 30g fiber per day
- 190g protein per day
- Bedtime: 6 out of 7 days per week
  - In bed by 10:00pm
  - Lights out by 10:30pm

## Progressive Training Goals:

### Running Progression (20 weeks)

- **Week 1:** 15:00 minutes
- **Week 20:** 30:00 minutes
- **Weekly increase:** ~3.72% compounded
- **Formula:** Week N = 15 × (1.0372)^(N-1) minutes

### Lifting Volume Progression

- **Weekly increase:** +2% total volume
- **Formula:** Week N = Baseline × (1.02)^(N-1)
- Track volume as: sets × reps × weight
- Apply multiplier to maintain progressive overload
