## Reality Check

You're 6 days into Week 1. Here's where you stand:

- **Calories:** On track
- **Steps:** On track  
- **Protein:** Only hitting 2/6 days (33%). This needs to improve.
- **Fiber:** Hitting 5/6 days (83%). Good, except Wednesday.
- **Training:** Lifts done, but still need 1 run

**Bottom line:** You have 1 day left to get that final run in. No excuses - you can run when tired. It's only 20 weeks. Stay consistent and you earn rest days.
