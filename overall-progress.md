# 20-Week Journey Progress

## Overall Stats

- **Start Date:** August 18, 2025
- **Current Week:** 1 of 20
  See what I put for protein, I think I want a similar visualization here but for each week where I hit the required goals I get a check, otherwise some kind of negative indicator like a sad face.

## Current Week Status

- **Current Calorie Average:** 1850
  Add a color code. Green if we're > 50 below 1900, yellow if we're + or - 50 from 1900, red if we're > 50 above 1900.
- **Days > 190g protein**
  Maybe add a visualazation, like imagine a row of cells, one for each day of the week, with a check in it if I consumed > 190g of protein and empty if not. somehow have an indication of the day of the week we are on
- **Days > 30g of fier:** 30g
  Do the same thing as the protein visualization
- **Current Steps Average:** 5000
  Add a color code, same as calories but plus or minus 500 steps instead of 50
- **Went to bed on time:**
  Same as the protein visualization, but for the sleep.
- **Woke up on time**
  Same as the went to bed visualization, but for the wake up.
- **Number of Runs** 2/3
  Progress bar here like current week?
